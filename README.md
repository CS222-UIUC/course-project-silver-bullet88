## Pitch:

"No more holding back, no more fear of judgment. Just pure honesty and pure fun!"

The objective of AskMe is to provide individuals with a secure platform to pose personal or sensitive inquiries and receive responses, while maintaining anonymity. AskMe engenders a feeling of comfort and security, enabling individuals to express themselves openly and receive sincere answers.
By allowing anonymity, AskMe can also encourage people to ask more candid questions and provide more honest answers, leading to deeper conversations and better understanding between friends. Additionally, it can also serve as an entertaining activity, such as playing truth or dare games.

## Components:
### Frontend: 
We will use the HTML, CSS, JavaScript programming language and the React framework. We chose HTML, CSS and JavaScript due to its speed, simplicity, and popularity. The benefit of the React framework includes having potential to reuse components and easy to use for building a rich UI. We will test our functionalities using React Testing Library which provides light utility functions for us to interact with our React components so that we can experience as a website user and make meaningful updates.

### Backend: 

We use Javascript and React framework to write our backend code, with Google Firebase.JavaScript is a highly performant language and can handle a lot of concurrent connections, making it suitable for building scalable backend applications. Besides, JavaScript can be used on both the client and server side, allowing for a seamless transfer of data between the front-end and the back-end. The React framework is built with components, which can be reused and combined to create complex UIs. Similarly, code written for the backend can also be easily reused and modularized, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.JavaScript and React allow for rapid development and iteration, making it easier to quickly prototype and test ideas. Firebase provides real-time data synchronization between clients, making it easy to create collaborative, real-time applications. Firebase's serverless architecture means you don't have to write any server-side code to get started. Firebase can easily scale to handle large volumes of data and traffic. Firebase can be easily integrated with other Firebase services, as well as third-party services like Google Cloud Platform.
